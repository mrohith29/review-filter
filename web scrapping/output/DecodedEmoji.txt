A good budget smartphone for the price range
Redmi reduced the earphone \Volume (when connecting a earphone the volume is comparatively lower than Redmi 6). I don't know all the latest models comes with this much sound only. Need to check that before buy.

Nice moblieVerry nice
Good mobile fone at thi price range nice camera  storage
Phone ho to aisa. Everything is Nice. I love it.
Good for this price range
Super quality mobile nice experienceThe phone doesn't come with fast charging, you get 18w charging, screen and touch are responsive. The touch response is slower than a Realme Gt Neo 3T. Too much of bloatware. 128GB for 7700 is it's USP.
Best in this price segment
Worth for money
NicenessNice productNo split screen supported.System apps update only on settings.Play Store me sab app ka update chahiye tha.18 watt charger de dete ,100-200 le kar .Although spend money on 5g not in 4g .Redmi UI is worse than others.If you have money buy Samsung f14 5g and potronics charger and type c cable.If you are broke then go for it . This is not bad.A/C to price this is the best phone so far.
You can't buy any better phone that has all basic necessities like dedicated sim slots, 3.5 mm jack, very premium finish.
Very good :thumbsup:Nice running after 3 months of purchase
Satisfied
Pasand haiSlow proceser .. touch is also not responsive quick . It is just ok mobile for lite work only
Average performance.
its good picyure clarity is good its worth it
LikeOkay for the price. Am feeling good.
THE VOLUME OF RECEIVING CALLS IS VERY LOW IN THE SET. MAY BE VOLUME CONTROL FAULTS
Nice quality
Features are good as per price. Worth buying
I liked the product but it reached 1 day later as per the given date as I had selected the fast delivery option by paying 99â‚¹ extra but it reached on 24 July..so it's not acceptable... that's the only issue otherwise satisfied with the product.
The phone is good but comes soon with a HyperOS update. The problem is that MI hasn't implemented the update properly leading to an unstable OS or something that doesn't sync
Recieved like new one.

The mobile phone is of Good quality. I am satisfied.
The large battery capacity provides long-lasting use, which is a significant advantage. The camera performance may not be up to par with more expensive smartphones, especially in low light.
