Nice camera, sound, value for money mobile. Ease of use...
I purchased this mobile to play free fire, it runs very well in standard quality, but there is no game turbo, voice changer, split screen option in this mobileüò≠, it stacks and restart when I open and using a heavy apps, average camera quality but best quality in this budget range, slow downloading on mobile data, battery backup is not bad.  but I liked this phone in this price segment.Review after using 7 days

Received a product that is and performs above par what else can i say I do not know how toor in which way to pay the due respect to this product
Appearance of mobile is good and quality of sound is just ok mobile is not hanging  ease of use overall good mobile in affordable  budgetNo heating problemTouch is goodBattery life is the biggest  problem  if we see 10 minute  video battery drains quickly  from 80 to 60 I faced personally
Product is ok as per priceCamera 3/5Battery 4/5Look 4/5Price 5/57600Rs
User friendly mobile and battery backup is excellent. Overall good mobile for buying
After 3days of usage for 6/128gb phone myoverall experience is good whether it comes in terms for camera clarity, games, phone system processor.,display quality is very good as compare to price range of this phone. No heating issues and no lagging issues were found till nowCons -speaker Sound of this phone is not upto the mark quality need to be improved .Battery üîãdrains very early as compare to other phones with same battery size. As I have to charge my new phone twice due to heavy internet usage.üîã‚ö° takes approx more than 2hours to be full .No quick charging is there in this phone.Overall we can consider this phone if u are okay with the battery üîãin this budget.
No split screen supported.System apps update only on settings.Play Store me sab app ka update chahiye tha.18 watt charger de dete ,100-200 le kar .Although spend money on 5g not in 4g .Redmi UI is worse than others.If you have money buy Samsung f14 5g and potronics charger and type c cable.If you are broke then go for it . This is not bad.A/C to price this is the best phone so far.
Camera quality good for this price .battery life good .looking good .
This is a perfect product for the money spend and the my requirements for personal and professional usage. Highly recommend

Good product with 256 GB memory, 8+8 GB RAM. But camera quality is not very good.
Such a nice product. I got same product as mentioned in picture platform's site..üëåüëç thanks amazonüôÇ
Bought it at 7800 4G version. And it's a well to do phone for your daily task. I'm iphone 13 mini user needed an Android so got this one. The phone is little broad  requires you to use both your hands unlike the iphone mini.Camera iQuality is still in 2013. Speaker from 2009.
Purchased the product a month back. IN daylight it is difficult to see the screen even if put for good brightness.
Not satisfied because the seller didn't give brochure or guide book.even buttons in the cell phone not known to the customer.The seller gave some box mentioning 8 gb ram 128 gb volume. The box is not relevant to selling item.  NO GUIDE BOOK,NO BROCHURE,HOW TO START THE PHONE..Amazon  has to re think to give order to "Darshita Assiyana pvt ltd,chettipalayam,coimbatore."Basic sense of backing not available. I think they have sold very old stock.Existing cell send to customer

Very very low sound quality, but ok.
Average
If you can see the uploded screenshot their is promt," press again to exit". The prompt is normal, however it remains on the screen for very long time. Similar promot Or notification appers while using many other apps and it literally covers screen. Especially keyboard. Can anybody explain what kind of notification is this and how to get rid of it?
Great product in this price
Camera is not so good , features, speed, body is good.
Super mobile eady to use great battery awesome sound quality
Good phone packed with features at this price
I like it,, it is best for old people,, average in games
Last December i purchase the phone.till the february the call recording app was not working.

Worth buying at low price
Low display quality
Camera quality good and bettery back up ok everything is good
The overall phone design and appearance looks perfect but the most Important and frustrating thing is it's problem of overheating just after using it for 30-40 ?mins.... I also experienced a bit of framedrops while watching YT and the screen laggs often.
