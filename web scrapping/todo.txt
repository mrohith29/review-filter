reviews -> language translation -> emoji decoding

- [x] reviews
- [x] language translation
- [x] emoji decoding
- [x] sentiment analysis

for sentiment analysis, we will use the reviews and translate them to English, then decode the emojis and then perform sentiment analysis on the reviews.

In sentiment analysis, we have used SentimentIntensityAnalyzer from nltk library to get the sentiment scoreof the reviews and then classified them as positive, negative or neutral based on the score.

The sentiment score is calculated using the polarity_score and as follows:
- positive sentiment: compound score >= 0.05
- neutral sentiment: compound score > -0.05 and compound score < 0.05
- negative sentiment: compound score <= -0.05
